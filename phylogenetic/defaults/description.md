We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work.

Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.

Much of the recent genomic data here comes from the publication [Naveca et al 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.07.23.24310415) but more recent sequences from NCBI may not yet be published.

We maintain three views of Oropouche virus evolution: one showing evolution of the [L segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/L), one for the [M segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/M),and the other showing evolution of the [S segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/S). A tangle tree showing [co-evolution of L and M](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/L:oropouche/M) is also available.

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as the starting point for our analyses. Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:

##### L segment
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/metadata.tsv.zst)

##### M segment
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/metadata.tsv.zst)

##### S segment
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/metadata.tsv.zst)
