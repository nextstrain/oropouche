We gratefully acknowledge the authors, originating and submitting laboratories of the genetic sequences and metadata for sharing their work.

Please note that although data generators have generously shared data in an open fashion, that does not mean there should be free license to publish on this data. Data generators should be cited where possible and collaborations should be sought in some circumstances. Please try to avoid scooping someone else's work. Reach out if uncertain.

Much of the recent genomic data here comes from the publication [Naveca et al 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-024-03300-3) (labeled as Almeida et al. and Silva et al. in this analysis based on GenBank entries) but more recent sequences from NCBI may not yet be published.

We maintain three views of Oropouche virus evolution across different viral segments: for the [L segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/L), for the [M segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/M) and for the [S segment](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/S). Tangle trees showing co-evolution across segments are also available: for [L and M](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/L:oropouche/M), for [L and S](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/L:oropouche/S) and for [M and S](https://nextstrain.org/oropouche/M:oropouche/S).

#### Underlying data

We curate sequence data and metadata from NCBI as the starting point for our analyses.
Metadata is grouped by strain name with segment-specific information encoded using a '_{segment}' suffix.
Curated sequences and metadata are available as flat files at:

* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/metadata.tsv.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/metadata.tsv.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/L/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/M/sequences.fasta.zst)
* [data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/sequences.fasta.zst](https://data.nextstrain.org/files/workflows/oropouche/S/sequences.fasta.zst)
